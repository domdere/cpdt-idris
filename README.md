# Certified Programming with Dependent Types

This is my [**Idris**] [idris-lang] sandbox for my "Code-A-Long" with the CPDT book.

Its not intended to have complete coverage of the book, and there aren't any exercises.

Its mainly for me to work through concepts that I can't grok directly from the prose.

Adam Chlipala uses *crush* to just trivially crank out a lot of results and sometimes
I just need to work through the proof manually to understand why something is.
