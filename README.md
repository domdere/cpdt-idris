Well its not a verbatim quote, but I think he said something along those lines and I would agree on that point.

And he probably wouldn't suggest learning FP with **Idris** either...

**Haskell** is my favourite language, but I figured I would take the chance to try out **Idris** for something different.

These are my attempts to work through the exercises in [**Functional Programming in Scala**] [fp-in-scala] in [**Idris**] [idris-lang]
